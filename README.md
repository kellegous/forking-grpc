# Forking gRPC!

#### Getting started.

 1. From your laptop, first run `script/bootstrap`

 2. This will launch a bash shell running in docker, then run `make test`

Hopefully that worked. Note that the first time you run this, it's going to take long af. That's because the commands try to build, download and will into place all the things you need. Subsequent runs should be considerably faster.
